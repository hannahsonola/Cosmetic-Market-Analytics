3. *Boost Visibility* via review campaigns and influencer marketing, especially on underperforming platforms  
4. *Promote Niche Categories* like serums or powder eye products to reduce competition and tap new demand  
5. *Cross-Sell Products* by bundling top-performing categories (e.g., Lip + Face kits) to increase AOV

## 🧾 Conclusion

This dashboard reveals how India and the U.S. differ in product assortment, pricing strategy and brand maturity. The U.S. favors premium diversity and customer engagement, while India thrives on affordability and mass appeal.

For brands, this highlights the importance of localized product and pricing strategies. For platforms, it’s a call to improve product visibility, foster feedback loops and create relevance because *price alone doesn't drive success.*
